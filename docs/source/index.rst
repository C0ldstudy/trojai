.. currentmodule:: trojai

``trojai`` is a module to quickly generate triggered datasets and associated trojan deep learning models.  It contains two submodules: ``trojai.datagen`` and ``trojai.modelgen``. ``trojai.datagen`` contains the necessary API functions to quickly generate synthetic data that could be used for training machine learning models. The ``trojai.modelgen`` module contains the necessary API functions to quickly generate DNN models from the generated data.

TODO: describe briefly what triggering datasets are, poisoned models are.  Link to the intro page for more detail ...
